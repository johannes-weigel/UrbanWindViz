# UrbanWindViz

UrbanWindViz is an open-source software prototype for the selective transformation and visualization of simulated urban wind fields on top of standard web-mapping systems.

The project was developed in the context of an academic research project at [Fachgebiet Skalierbare Softwaresysteme](https://www.tu.berlin/3s) of [Technische Universität Berlin](https://www.tu.berlin/).
It focuses on the efficient handling, transformation, and visualization of simulation-based wind data in a city-scale environment.

The source code of this project is openly available. The underlying simulation datasets operated on by the software are **not** part of this repository and are **not publicly available**.
